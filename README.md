## NSYSU_AdvanceML
NSYSU 2025 spring semester course  
CSE523 `進階機器學習 ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING`  
Instructor: 張雲南 (Yun-Nan Chang)

* HW1  
  1. Design a simple MLP (Multilayer perceptron) to classify circles_data.
     After training, drawing a decision boundary plot
  2. Do a math calculation about `Gradient Descent`.
* HW2
  1. Train a CNN on custom MNIST dataset (different that the network searched version)
  2. Show the `accuary` and `confusion matrix` of top1 and top3
  3. calculate the value of $$\frac{top \ 1 \ accuracy}{number \ of \ weights}$$
  4. Use such trained model to try to predict the result on Testing data and store the result into a CSV file.
* HW3
    Use RNN (including LSTM and GRU) model to do `classification`, `sentimental classification`, `NLP word prediction` tasks and show the accuracy statistics and confusion matrix.
    More information are writed in README in the HW3 folder.
